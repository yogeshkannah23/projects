            <h1>Segmentation and Classification of Interstitial
                Lung Diseases Based on Hybrid Deep
                Learning Network Model</h1>
            <p>Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are diverse diseases that share pathological, radiological,
                and clinical traits and involve interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. These have a significant impact on
                lung disease morbidity and mortality. From the lung High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)
                image, the region of interest (ROI) had to be manually identified for most of the early ILD classification
                investigations, which was time-consuming. Additionally, the clinical signs of various disorders are identical,
                which makes precise detection difficult. In recent studies, outstanding results were achieved in categorizing
                medical photos using deep learning techniques. For ILD classification, a hybrid deep learning network
                model has been developed in this research. The lung portion of the HRCT images was initially segmented
                using an improved U-Net++ model. The multi-scale improved U-Net++ module has been applied for
                effective lung segmentation with lung anomalies. The segmented lung image’s features were extracted
                for categorization in the second stage using a Refined Attention Pyramid Network (RAPNet). Then,
                we developed a MobileUNetV3 to classify five ILD classes. The ILD database is used to test the proposed
                approach. Due to the stage-by-stage improvement in the DL method performance, the proposed hybrid deep
                learning network model’s performance has significantly increased.
